# Privacy Policy – BonzAI
Last updated: January 19, 2026

The protection of your personal data is a priority for us. Here is how BonzAI, an iOS application, processes your information.

## 1. Data collected and stored

**BonzAI does not collect or store any personal data on its own servers.**

- **Local data:** your conversations, files, and documents are processed and stored directly on your iOS device. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to use external services.
- **No backend storage:** BonzAI does not have backend servers that collect, store, or process your personal information.

## 2. Third-party services

BonzAI allows you to connect to external AI providers and services. When you choose to use these services:

- **Third-party AI providers:** if you connect to remote services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), data is transmitted directly to these providers' servers. Their respective privacy policies and terms of service apply.
- **Local AI models:** BonzAI offers access to local AI models sourced from HuggingFace. Each model has its own terms and conditions that apply to its use.
- **Other external services:** if you integrate services like Home Assistant or other third-party platforms, their privacy policies apply to data shared with them.

You remain in full control of which services you connect to and what data you share.

## 3. Technical data

We may collect minimal anonymous technical information (app version, iOS version, crash reports) solely to improve app stability and performance. This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.

## 4. Use of data

- To provide the application's features (chat, document analysis, local AI processing).
- To improve user experience and fix technical issues.
- No commercial exploitation of your data is performed.

## 5. Data sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties, except:
- when you voluntarily connect to external services (their terms apply),
- when required by law.

## 6. Your rights

Since BonzAI does not store your data on servers, you have complete control over your data directly on your device. You can delete conversations, files, and app data at any time through your iOS device settings or within the app.

## 7. Policy modifications

We may update this policy to reflect changes to the application or legislation. You will be informed of significant changes through app updates.
